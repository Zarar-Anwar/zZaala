As a full stack developer with 2 years of experience, I have a strong
foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My expertise lies in creating
interactive and user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and a variety of frameworks such as ReactJs.

On the back-end, I have experience with server-side languages such as NodeJs,Express
as well as database technologies like MongoDB. I am proficient in developing RESTful
 APIs.

I am a problem-solver at heart and thrive in fast-paced environments where I can use my
skills to turn complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. I am a proactive learner 
and constantly seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.


In my previous roles, I have successfully delivered numerous projects for clients across a
variety of industries, including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. I am confident that my 
skills and experience make me a strong candidate for any full stack developer position.
